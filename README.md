# IonQ-Demo-HU
Demo for Ion Q using AWS
Hosted by Harrisburg University

November 16, 2020

Presentation and code developed by Alex Khan 
Portions of code were taken from AWS sample code


This is an introductory set for running IonQ using AWS Braket Service.

The presentation outlines the steps to get started with AWS Braket and 
provides a sample code (Jupyter notebook) with two example circuits
that can be run on IonQ and compared with other QPUs example IBM-Quantum.

The purpose of the demo is to show the higher quality results from an
actual quantum device due to the higher fidelity and full interconnectivity 
between the qubits.

It cant be overstated, that IonQ device has 11 ions suspended in a magnetic
field and are being used to compute through gate operations through laser beams.
